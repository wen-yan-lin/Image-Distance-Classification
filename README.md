# Image-Distance-Classification
Distance Based Image Classification: A solution to generative classificationâ€™s conundrum? 

Distance classification argues that the distance between image features are only meaningful if non-semantic noise cnacellation is applied. The code shows how such noise cancellation can be acheived; argues that normalization is just one  form of noise cancellation; and shows how distance based classification allows for effective incremental learning.

To create your own features from images, you can use the dir2feat function in dir_util.py
